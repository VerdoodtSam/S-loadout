Welcome!!!</br>
This is the github repo for my project one in 1MCT at HoWest. </br>
Here you will find the code and documentation needed to replicate my project!</br>
</br>
The code needed for the RPi and ESP32 have been both separated for ease of use.

Info for the project:
I have created a smart fencing loadout which allows the wearer to monitor various vital functions

- The heart rate of the wearer
- The Acceleration of your movements
- The Air humidity within your mask

I created this as part of my studies in HoWest Kortrijk
